<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate Web Developer who turns ideas into interactive, user-friendly experiences. I specialize in crafting modern, responsive websites that not only look beautiful but also perform flawlessly across all devices. My toolbox includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, but my real skill lies in solving problems creatively and translating concepts into clean, functional code.

I thrive on continuous learning, staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on the web. Whether it’s optimizing performance, enhancing user experience, or integrating cutting-edge features, I’m always up for a challenge.

When I’m not coding, you might find me exploring new design inspirations, experimenting with animations, or diving into side projects that combine art and technology. I believe every project is an opportunity to tell a story, and I make sure each one leaves a lasting impression.
